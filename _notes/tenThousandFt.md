## Base
> NOTE: changing d3 to jit
- ~~d3~~jit will be outside of any shadow root.

    - http://philogb.github.io/jit/static/v20/Docs/files/Core/Core-js.html
  - Seems like putting it inside of one could cause unneeded complications
    - see below for elements included in d3
- Will contain module inputs for:
  - Instructions
  - Log (section='arweave | user | comments')
  - Options
  - Profile
  - StatsDapp

## Front End Break Down

### D3
- Will look like a mind map
  - disconnected nodes
    - center node will be base url that was saved
      - will have unique color
    - linked nodes of same color on short _arms_ will be internal links
    - linked nodes of diff color on long _arms_ will be external links
  - on **HOVER** _ALL_ links/urls/nodes that have been saved to perma web will:
    - display thumbnail img of saved site
      - will include created timestamp
      - will include transaction link
        - username if available ?
  - on **CLICK** _ALL_ unsaved links will:
    - open link in new window/tab
    - display form to allow user to paste transaction ID
      - TODO: see if we can automate this
        - SHOULD BE ABLE TO! `async createTransaction(attributes, jwk) {`
          - pass in data and all the other info needed

### Instructions
- Will accordion style down and up to display how the dApp works
- For IE will toggle open and closed

### Log (section='arweave')
- Will be card like and show logs pertaining to entire dApp
### Log (section='user')
- Will be card like and show logs pertaining to specific user
### Log (section='comments')
- Will be card like and show logs pertaining to comments
### Options
- Will control filtering and display of the d3 graph based on user input
### Profile
- Will contain info related to current user
  - avatar
  - name
  - email
  - amount of sites saved to perma web from dApp
  - amount of previously saved sites viewed
  - amount of new sites explored (saved or not the count increases)
### StatsDapp
  - Will contain info related to entire application
    - amount of total pages saved
    - most recent page saved
    - amount of unique users who have saved pages
    - top user who has saved page?

## ~~Back End Break Down~~ [_**DEPRECATED**_]
###### Pretty sure I can handle all of this just from what is returned with the txn queries
### Internal Fetches
- [GET] User specific stats
- [GET] App specific stats
### External Endpoints
- [GET] /recent/{amt}
  - utilize something along the lines of:
    - https://mdflqndwudrx.arweave.net/A7ctf1azriZxHGWKurMQfDFrGOncG-MBn4A59Tt1kzw/index.html#/transactions
  - filter Content-Type === 'text/html'
    - _**return**_
      - txn
      - page:url
      - page:title
      - page:timestamp
      - data
- [GET] /links?url={url+encoded+url}
  - scrape url
  - _**return**_
    - internal links
    - external links
